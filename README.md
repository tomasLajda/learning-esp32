# Learning ESP32 platform

I am trying to get more familiar with iot, so I started to learn esp32. 
It was recommended to me as great and cheap device to get into iot world.

The projects are made with PlatformIO extention to VSCode and Arduino API to manipulate controller with ease.
This repo will contain multiple branches every with different ESP projects.
